# bundle loader for webpack with promise API

## Usage

[Documentation: Using loaders](http://webpack.github.io/docs/using-loaders.html)

This is a ripoff of [bundle-loader](https://github.com/webpack/bundle-loader) that uses promises instead of callbacks.
It only supports what is `lazy` mode in `bundle-loader`â€”that is, `require` returns a function that, when invoked, returns a promise that resolves to the module.

It's up to you to specify your Promise library of choice as a parameter.

``` javascript
// Assuming you use Bluebird
var load = require("promise?bluebird!./file.js");

// The chunk is not requested until you call the load function
load().then(function(file) {

});
```
